This is a modification of "silver bells" and "boxy" styles for drupals advanced forum module.  

To install:
Extract to your modules/advanced_forum/styles directory.  This directory will have all the other 
advanced_forum styles in it like boxy, boxy_stacked, naked, etc...

Flush your drupal cache, then go to admin/settings/advanced-forum and set the style to "Drupal 
Commons AF"


* NOTE: I use this theme JUST to style the forums, not the actual forum node.  To do that:

- go here: admin/settings/advanced-forum
- DE-select everything under "Node types to style"
- click save
